SNAC-Pack is an integrated framework that automates the discovery and optimization of neural networks with a focus on FPGA deployment. By leveraging surrogate models, it eliminates the need for time-intensive synthesis during the neural architecture search process, enabling rapid exploration of the design space while maintaining accurate predictions of hardware performance metrics.
