We create a plug-and-play pipeline **Morph** that uses block based layers of a network to run Neural Architecture Search to find the optimal model for a given task. Then the pipeline runs quantization and pruning and makes a Pareto curve that the user can choose based on their needs. This is specifcally tailored for CPUs and FPGAs.
