# Internship Experience at HYQU Laboratory, ETH Zürich - Summer 2022

## Overview
During the summer following my first year at university, I had the opportunity to intern at the Hybrid Quantum systems group (HYQU) at ETH Zürich. This experience was pivotal in applying my theoretical knowledge in physics to practical challenges in the field of experimental physics.

## Project Focus
My primary responsibility was to design and implement a stabilization system to suppress vibrations in the Cryostat Fabry-Perot interferometer experiment. The goal was to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the experimental setup.

### Design and Development
- **Differential Equations:** I utilized my understanding of physics to derive a system of differential equations, focusing on amplitude attenuation in various systems. This theoretical framework was crucial for developing a viable solution.
