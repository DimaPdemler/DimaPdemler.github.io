    We create a plug-and-play pipeline called Morph that leverages block-based neural network layers to perform Neural Architecture Search, discovering the optimal model architecture for any given task. The pipeline then applies quantization and pruning techniques to generate a Pareto curve, allowing users to select the model that best meets their specific requirements. This approach is specifically tailored for deployment on CPUs and FPGAs.

<p>
    Our automated pipeline streamlines the neural architecture codesign process for physics applications. By incorporating hardware costs into our neural architecture search methodology, we discover more hardware-efficient neural architectures. Our approach not only surpasses existing performance benchmarks across various tasks but also achieves additional speedup through model compression techniques, including quantization-aware-training and neural network pruning. We transform these optimal models into high-level synthesis code for FPGA deployment using the hls4ml library. Furthermore, our hierarchical search space provides enhanced optimization flexibility, making it readily adaptable to different tasks and domains.
</p>

<p>
    We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two detailed case studies: Bragg peak finding in materials science and jet classification in high energy physics.
