We create a plug-and-play pipeline **Morph** that uses block based layers of a network to run Neural Architecture Search to find the optimal model for a given task. Then the pipeline runs quantization and pruning and makes a Pareto curve that the user can choose based on their needs. This is specifcally tailored for CPUs and FPGAs. 

This is an ongoing project and is done with [Javier Duarte](https://jduarte.physics.ucsd.edu/). We currently have one paper written about this seen [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.05978.pdf) and is described in more detail in the [Publications section](https://dimapdemler.github.io/publications/).
