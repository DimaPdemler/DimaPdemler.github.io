I am a competitive person and as a result I love playing sports and try to play as recreationally 
as much as I can. I primarily play tennis and basketball. For tennis, I have played since I was very little and am an active member of the UCSD competitive club tennis team. We have practices several times a week and tournaments a few times a quarter. I try to play basketball a few times a week, I am usually in the center position (being 6'6" helps) and play in the intramural university league almost every quarter.


Aside from these competitive sports I also enjoy hiking and skiing which works great with me being in Switzerland so often! My favorite moutains so far is [mout Pilatus](https://www.pilatus.ch/en/) and Piz Segnas. I also love playing chess, refusing any opening except for the danish gambit ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°ðŸ’ª.
